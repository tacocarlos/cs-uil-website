Nepal is the only nation in the world that does not have a quadrilateral flag! The flag instead looks like two overlaid pennants (a kind of triangle). The pennants have different shapes and sizes, which makes reproducing the Nepalese flag faithfully a difficult task.

Bipul wants to make an ASCII-art outline of a Nepalese flag. In his recreation, both pennants have a width of 11 characters. Furthermore, the top pennant overlaps the tip of the bottom pennant.

**Input:** There is no input file for this problem.

**Output"** Output the Nepalese flag as shown below.

**Expected Exact Output**:
