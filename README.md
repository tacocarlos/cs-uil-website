# Carlos Luna CS UIL Website
A website created for GHS Computer Science UIL. Main feature is the existence of previous programming problems and leaderboard, allowing my team members to engage in jolly competition.

# Deployment
For other coaches who might be interested in deploying this (or, rather, fork it and edit it), there are three components. Firstly, the website itself is hosted on Vercel, which has its own deployment guide directly from GitHub. The second is a `postgres` database, hosted however you want. I host mine on a Hetzner VPS running Coolify, which runs the docker container for a postgres db for me. Finally, I run `judge0` on a Hetzner VPS with dedicated CPU cores for faster code execution. However, it is pretty annoying to use, requiring you to enable cgroup v1 on an ubuntu server.
